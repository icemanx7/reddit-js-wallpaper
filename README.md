# reddit-js-wallpaper
Scrapes reddit for 1080p wallpapers

# Why?

Because I got tired of having to download individual pictures from various sites and everytime I reinstall or move to a new dev machine
So I write this script that populates my pictures folder with the front page pics of the reddit subreddit wallpapers. I then run a bash
script that randomly chooses a pic every 30s and makes that my wallpaper. 

# How?

It is written in Javascript using the snoowrap reddit api.

# TODO

 * Add support for Imgur API
 * Add a counter that runs until the desired number of pictures is download.
 * Ignore the failed ones
